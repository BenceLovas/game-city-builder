- shields light up when a city gets finished
- some cool effect when a city is finished
- some cool effect when a road gets finished

- make small cities have 45 angle on side as well - just create an outline for it so it is visible when there is 2 separate elements
- create components
- always show current card on top (fixed absolute thingy)
- add formatting
- when placing cards it should be a valid place

- stop rerender on rotate
